MMU Campus Water Fountain Locator

This project was developed as part of the "Team Project" module during my first year at university. It’s a 
collaborative app that helps students, faculty, and staff at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) 
locate water fountains around campus. By showing their exact locations on Google Maps, the app makes it 
easy for users to quickly find nearby fountains in specific buildings.

Features
* Interactive Map Display: View water fountain icons on Google Maps.
* Location Coverage: Currently includes fountains in three main buildings:

- Business School
- Dalton Building
- The Saints Library

Fountain Details: Each location provides:
* Temperature options (hot or cold water)
* Image for easy identification
* A description for additional context

Purpose
The app’s purpose is to offer an easy and quick way to find water fountains around the MMU campus. This 
helps users save time and promotes environmental sustainability by encouraging the use of refillable water 
bottles.
